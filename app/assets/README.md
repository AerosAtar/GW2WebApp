###What belongs in the assets folder?

The assets folder should contain any assets needed for 
the app that are not angular-specific. For example, 
this might include images, data files and Sass files 
(and once compiled, the resulting CSS files will also 
be placed in the `assets` directory).

###How is the assets folder organised?

The assets folder should be organised by asset type. 
For example, images belong inside `assets/img`, Sass 
files belong inside `assets/scss`, etc.
