### What belongs in the config folder?
The `config` folder is for holding application 
configuration files. Generally these will be javascript
files that contain configuration for various parts of
the application (for example, URLs of external
services). When building the application, the `config`
directory will be copied directly to the `dist`
directory, and no transformation will be done on the
contained files (i.e. they will be human-readable).
